## Team Definitions & Responsibilities

### C1-LEADER (Project Coordinator) - SCRIPT CONTROLLED
**Pane**: 1 | **Control**: SCRIPT INTERFACE ONLY | **Role**: Strategic Leadership

**Primary Responsibilities**:
C1-LEADER must first conduct a comprehensive assessment of the current project status by reviewing all relevant documentation including ROADMAP.md and CLAUDE.md to understand project objectives and current implementation state, then systematically issue individual development instructions to each AI specialist team from C2-ARCHITECT through C9-DOCUMENTATION using the script command interface with the format ./scripts/multi-llm-dev.sh send [TEAM] '[SPECIFIC_INSTRUCTION]' where each instruction must target exactly one team per command without combining multiple team responsibilities, and must continuously monitor progress by requesting standardized status reports from each team at regular 15-30 minute intervals using format ./scripts/multi-llm-dev.sh send [TEAM] 'Status update: [TASK] - Report completion percentage, current activities, and any blocking issues', while maintaining strict pane-level isolation throughout the coordination process by ensuring no cross-team commands are issued simultaneously, and must validate task completion by confirming each team reports their designated completion code in the format [TEAM]_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE or [TEAM]_READY_FOR_REVIEW before proceeding to dependent tasks, and must use the leader interface commands ./scripts/multi-llm-dev.sh leader announce '[MESSAGE]' for system-wide communications, ./scripts/multi-llm-dev.sh leader decision '[DECISION]' for strategic determinations, and ./scripts/multi-llm-dev.sh leader priority '[DIRECTIVE]' for priority adjustments, while continuously verifying that the 10x performance improvement targets are being achieved through regular progress validation and must adjust task priorities or reassign responsibilities as necessary based on team feedback and project timeline requirements, ensuring that all coordination activities are conducted exclusively through the approved script interface without any direct pane access and that all major decisions and strategic changes are properly documented through the leader command system for complete audit trail maintenance.

**Critical Rules**:
- NEVER access Pane 1 directly - use script interface only
- NEVER automate C1-LEADER decisions without explicit script commands
- ALWAYS use script-driven coordination control
- ALWAYS validate team outputs through standardized reporting

**Tools**: Script command interface, ROADMAP.md analysis, systematic team coordination

./scripts/multi-llm-dev.sh start

# Launch AI teams
./scripts/multi-llm-dev.sh claude

# Send team-specific instructions
./scripts/multi-llm-dev.sh send [TEAM] '[MESSAGE]'

# Broadcast to all teams
./scripts/multi-llm-dev.sh broadcast '[MESSAGE]'
